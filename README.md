Small project with such things: CoreData, Autolayout, Alamofire, Delegate, POP

What can We in this app: 
 - With Core Data we can check users, which want to pass validation level of the app;
 - After the passing validation process, user can choose: send a mail to someone , or watch gallery;
 - Mail class - it is just a prototype, I will realize it in future :)
 - With the help of Alamofire we can download pictures to our gallery.
